Dual Rotor

This repo contains correct description of dual rotor scheme and how to achieve extra effiency.

Actually, Dual rotor motors are more suitable for high-speed applications.
Because of hysteresis and eddy currents, when you have lower power for hysteresis and eddy currents, than in motors with one rotors.

Power for eddy currents is P~f^2

Lets define total drive speed as F
so, to get that speed you take motor with two rotors.


F=F1+F2

P1 ~ F1^2+F2^2

P2 ~ (F1+F2)^2

Obviously P2>> P1


That means that two rotor motors are more suitable for high-speed application than single-rotor motors.

On that image F1=F2 = W

Total rotation speed is 2*W.

Hysteresis frequency is W.

Simple winding for radial and axial two rotor motors.
For a described scheme we have 2 less power for hysteresis and 4 times less power for eddy current.
