Dual Rotor

This repo contains correct description of dual rotor scheme and how to achieve extra effiency.

Actually, Dual rotor motors are more suitable for high-speed applications.
Because of hysteresis and eddy currents, when you have lower power for hysteresis and eddy currents, than in motors with one rotors
Power for eddy currents is P~f^2

Lets define total drive speed as F
so, to get that speed you take motor with two rotors
F=F1+F2
P1 ~ F1^2+F2^2
P2 ~ (F1+F2)^2

Obviously P2>> P1 

That means that two rotor motors are more suitable for high-speed application than single-rotor motors.
